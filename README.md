### Project Title
Exploring and Understanding US bikeshare Data

### Description
The bikeshare.py file contains a Python script designed to analyze bikeshare data from three major US cities: Washington, Chicago, and New York City. Utilizing the powerful Pandas library along with NumPy operations, the script allows users to interactively explore the data.

Users can select various filters, including the city, month, and day, to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis. The script provides insights into several key metrics, such as:

Trip Duration: Average and total trip times.
User Statistics: Breakdown of users by type (e.g., subscriber, customer) and gender.
Time Analysis: Peak times for bike usage, including hour and day of the week.
Popularity Metrics: Most frequently used start and end stations for trips.
Additionally, if users are interested in examining the raw data, the script offers a command-line interface option to display the dataset in its entirety.

The program operates in a cyclical manner, prompting users to explore different queries until they choose to exit. This interactive design ensures a user-friendly experience, making it easy to derive valuable insights from the bikeshare data.

### Files used
The Python script in the bikeshare.py file utilizes three CSV files—chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv—which contain bikeshare data for their respective cities. Each CSV file includes various details such as trip duration, start and end times, user types, and more. Additionally, the bikeshare_2.py file serves as the foundational framework for the development of this code, offering essential functions and structures that enhance the functionality and organization of the analysis. Together, these files enable users to conduct comprehensive data analyses and derive insights into bikeshare trends and patterns in these major urban areas.
