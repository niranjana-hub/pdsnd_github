### Project Title
Exploring and Understanding US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The bikeshare.py script analyzes bikeshare data from three U.S. cities: Washington, Chicago, and New York City. Using the Pandas library and NumPy operations, users can interact with the script to select various filters such as city, month, and day. This allows for detailed statistical analyses, including trip duration, user statistics, and the most popular start and end locations.

Users also have the option to view raw data through the command-line interface. The program runs in a loop, enabling users to continue exploring the data until they choose to exit.

### Files used
The python script in the bikeshare.py file uses three CSV files called chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv. Moreover, the bikeshare_2.py file provides the framework in which this code was developed on.

### Credits
Referred to Stack overflow for tips and tricks to writing good code and also used Code Beautify website to format python data and ensure proper readability
