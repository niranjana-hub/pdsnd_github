### Project Title
Exploring and Understanding US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The provided code in the bikeshare.py file is a script aiming to analyse bikeshare data from three US cities (Washington, Chicago and New York City). Through the use of Pandas library and Numpy operations, users can interact with the script to prompt them to select data like city, month and day to achieve a detailed statistical analysis of information like time, trip duration statistics, user statistics and even most popular start and end statistics. If the user wishes to see raw data, then can choose to view this as well through the command-line interface. This is a cyclical program that continues the program to keep exploring until the user decides to exit.

### Files used
The python script in the bikeshare.py file uses three CSV files called chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv. Moreover, the bikeshare_2.py file provides the framework in which this code was developed on.

### Credits
Referred to Stack overflow for tips and tricks to writing good code and also used Code Beautify website to format python data and ensure proper readability
